			<p> I've already been forgetting that I've made this semi-blog thing. Oh well, whenever I do remember it I'll update
				it. <br />Anyways tomorrow is going to be my first day of Fall semester. <br />Here's another song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QicNRgElCsk" target="_blank">"Tear You Apart"</a> by She Wants Revenge

			<p> Earlier today I was bored and started to look around on my computer and I found an old python file called 
				"monopoly.py", so I decided to open it and I remembered what it was.<br />I was learning about the graphics.py 
				module and was trying to make Monopoly with it, I didn't finish the file so right now it can only select 
				between 2-4 players, create a board, and roll 2 dice, no movement or cards.<br />I'll go back to it soon but 
				looking at the code behind it I won't be too quick to get back into it. Anyways here's another song:

			<p> So this is just here for the logs because this was the day this site was created. Here's a 
				link to a song I like: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SshrAVY-RKY" target="_blank">"Cutie Cutie"</a>
