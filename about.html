			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hello, my name is TrueHeart Corona, with my online alias being "Rute21".
				I'm currently a Freshman in college that's majoring in Computer Science.
				I currently know a good amount of Python and I'm continuing to teach myself C++, Java and HTML.
				<br />Sometime I'll be branching out to other languages but for now this will do for me. I'm still not 
				certain why I decided to make this blog, I just thought about doing something and this was part of it. 
				<br />I would consider myself an avid gamer with my two favourite game series being Fire Emblem and Metroid, 
				both of which are from Nintendo, but I do mainly play other games. <br />This blog will more than likely be 
				random in it's content, but I am planning on making a romhack for either Fire Emblem 7 or 8, so it will 
				focus on that after a little bit. <br />Well, that's all I'll be putting for now, seeya.
